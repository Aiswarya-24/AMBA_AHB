### AMBA AHB Protocol Implementation in Verilog HDL

#### Overview
This Verilog HDL implementation optimizes a subset of the AMBA AHB (Advanced High-Performance Bus) protocol for high-performance on-chip communication within complex System-on-Chips (SoCs). It covers essential aspects such as address decoding, data transfer (read/write), and control signal handling.

#### Key Features
- **Address Decoding**: Efficient decoding of addresses to enable proper routing within the SoC.
- **Data Transfer**: Implementation of data transfer mechanisms for both read and write operations.
- **Control Signal Handling**: Proper management of control signals to ensure reliable communication between IP cores, memories, and peripherals.

#### Application
The integration of AMBA AHB in SoCs enables seamless and high-performance data transfer among various components such as IP cores, memories, and peripherals. This implementation provides a solid foundation for building complex SoCs with optimized on-chip communication.

#### Tools Used
- **Xilinx Vivado**: The implementation is designed and tested using Xilinx Vivado, a powerful tool for FPGA development.


#### How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aiswarya-24/amba-ahb-verilog.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xilinx Vivado.
3. Simulate or synthesize the design to observe its behavior.
4. Integrate the AMBA AHB modules into your SoC design for high-performance on-chip communication.
